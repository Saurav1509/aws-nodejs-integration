Using a nodejs server to push messages in AWS SQS and Trigger AWS Lambdas
Hi!!


This repo is doing something which is already done by aws but is more customized to do what i wanted it to do.

That thing is the aws console!! 

So i wanted aws console to start multiple services at the same time which are required for the working of an application.

Like an application will have its front-end and its backend so this will help with that.
